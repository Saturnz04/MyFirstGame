# MyFirstGame
This game was developed during my first semester in Computing Science. It is still missing some things, we had to use https://www.appgamekit.com/ to do a game in six months. I'm more proud with the pixel art of the main character that i did than the game itself.

obs: the game did get slower when recorded and i couldnt do nothing about it.
